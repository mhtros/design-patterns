# BUILDER PATTERN

Builder is a creational pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step.

## Pattern structure

---

**Builder**: Is the abstraction (abstract class or interface) that
defines all the related steps that need it to create a complex object.

**Concrete Builders**: The different implementations of builder abstraction. Although all concrete builder have the same
step methods they are not required to return the same class type.

_Note_: You can use the concrete builder object at it is to manually create the object step by step or you can pass it
down at a director (see below) class to preconfigure the object steps.

**Products**: Its the classes that will be generated by the concrete builders.

**Director**: Objects that takes a concrete builder as parameter into the constructor. And use this concrete builder to
create products using preconfigured steps.

_Note_: Usually director classes implements a `ChangeBuilder` method in order to switch concrete builder implementation
at
runtime.

**Client**: Its the class that associates a directory class with a given concrete builder.

## When to use Builder pattern?

1. When you have multiple overloading constructors or a single constructor with more than 10 parameters.

2. When you want to create different representation states of the same class.
